Hello 👋
My name is João Guilherme dos Santos. I’m a Brazilian full-stack software developer, and my main languages are TypeScript, Go, and Python.

Right now, I’m focused on becoming a better developer by learning more about DevOps, cloud, Linux, Docker, and backend development (which is my favorite area). I’m also studying data structures and algorithms, and I want to deepen my knowledge of computer science, low-level programming, networking, and cybersecurity.

My long-term goal is to become a great software engineer, capable of designing and building robust, high-quality software systems.
